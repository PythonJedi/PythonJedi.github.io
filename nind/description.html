    <h1>NindIsNonsense,Distilled</h1>

  <div class=note>This page currently under construction!

  <div class=p>The search for the ideal programming language has led many a programmer on wild goose chases. Some realize that there is no ideal language for every purpose. Others never find a language they're happy with. A few endeavor to create their own. Even fewer finish. Aside from being distilled nonsense, nind is not a programming language! It is a family of languages, much as its predecessor lisp or lisp-like cousins. Nind's focus is describing an extention of the basic lisp constructs that allow for strong algebraic typing. What these types are and how they are implemented is completely outside the scope of nind. One may also notice that nind shares ideas from haskell, whose algebraic type system is quite well-formed and robust while remaining purely functional. 
</div>
  <div class=section>Why 
  <div class=p>Because I keep reading about these awesome things like algebraic datatypes and s-expressions and I want to merge them into an awesome language family.

  <div class=section>Generic Nind 
  <div class=p>Note that any code examples are going to be in generic nind. This is a nind form that requires no lexing beyond turning text into lists of symbols. Generic nind also assumes that any free symbols are bound in an enclosing prelude. 
</div>
</div>
  <div class=section>S-Expressions 
  <div class=p>S-expressions are the core textual representation of any lisp derivitive, producing a nested list of atoms which we may evaluate. 
</div>

  <div class=section>Kappa Calculus 
  <div class=p>Kappa calculus (which has nothing to do with the integral or differential calculus you may be familiar with) is a formal system for creating first-order functions. It is not as extensible as the lambda calculus, which can derive functions that take other functions as arguments. This makes some aspects of a kappa-calculus language simpler, therefore, the first foray into a nind will be to derive a usable, strongly-typed kaapa calculus.
