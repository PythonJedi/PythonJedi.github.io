    So, why am I starting an essay on a strongly typed shell one with the least 
    strongly typed languages out there? I want to show an example of how terrible
    current systems are, and python uits the task perfectly. I'm also not great 
    with shell languages.)

    Let's make a simple script to used from the command line. I'm not particularly 
    intersted in what it does right now. Let's have (code foo, bar, and baz) 
    represent three different actions this script can do. Let's have those names be the 
    first argument to the script so the user can specify the action.)
  (code
    HELP = " Select from foo, bar baz."
    def foo():
      """ do ation foo... """
    def bar():
      """ do action bar... """
    def baz():
      """ do action baz... """
      
    if __name__ == "__main__":
      import sys
      act = {"foo": foo, "bar": bar, "baz", baz}
      if sys.argv[1] in act:
        act[sys.argv[1]]()
      else:
        print(HELP))
